The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.

We hope you've found some great books to help stay cool.Included in this release:- New book recommendations based on books that you've added on Goodreads- New book recommendations based on what's trending in the Goodreads community- Sharing a link to your profile- Many other bug fixes and improvements!          Ratings and Reviews        4.8 out of 5385K Ratings385K Ratings    Momma Flan, 05/08/2019    Perfect for book lovers or casual readers.I usually never write reviews, but my life as a reader was totally changed after finding this app.  I love books and always have, but life keeps you busy and you end up putting things aside.  Well, this app has helped me find so many books I NEED to read, and it has helped me rediscover my love for reading!  I really cant think of anything to improve. I love the layout. I love the ability to make shelves to save books.  It even lets you track the progress of books youre reading.  You can read your friends reviews or any reviews in general.  I also love that they have a vote at the end of the year (or beginning, I cant remember) for best books in SEVERAL genres and also have best of the best and whatnot.  Browsing books by categories is also great because its helping me find different kinds of books so my reading list can be more diverse.  The only complaint I have (which actually isnt a real complaint) is that every time I click on this app, I find a million more books I want to read and theres no way I can read them all in my lifetime.    donaldtrumpslefttoe, 05/14/2021    Hi Goodreads. PLEASE ADD THESE THINGSThis app is wonderful. It is almost perfect. BUT every person Ive talked to who uses Goodreads have all been in agreement it would be a GAME CHANGER if these were added: 1) A 0.5 star option. It sounds silly but it can be so frustrating deciding if a book it 4 or 5 stars. If there was a 4.5 option for example, I think all my life problems would be solved. 2) Private ratings. Im sure if youre an app developer you know of Letterboxd, and for me personally, if some similar features could be added to Goodreads that would make it just *chefs kiss*. For example: one of my favorite things about Letterboxd is how your ratings dont account to a larger average rating for a movie (but in this case it would be a book). You can rate a movie and write your OWN review describing how that movie fit into your personal taste. I would love to see this on Goodreads in a way in which I could do a private review (almost like a personal diary) rather than a public rating. Sometimes ill read a book and recognize its objectively a great book, but I might give it two starts because maybe that sub-genre of fantasy romance wasnt up my alley, so maybe that review would be nice to have in a personal journal rather than a public one because my review is sort of niche. I hope this makes sense. :))) I LOVE THIS APP!!!    Klsy303, 02/08/2018    Wonderful!I don't have room in my house for a bookcase nor do I have enough money to buy all the books I love and display them in my house. Therefore, when I found goodreads I found the perfect way to create a digital bookcase with reviews and all! I simply adore it :)My only wish would be a DNF category aside from the usual ones (i.e.- \"Currently Reading\", \"To Read\", \"Read\"). Right now I have a handful of books on my \"Read\" list even though I didn't finish them. I hate taking credit for reading a book when I didn't but if I take it off my list I'll forget I tried it and try to read it later. In addition, I read many books via audiobooks and I want to update my progress under currently reading but I have no way of knowing what page Im on and typing in the percentage is a pure guess. In order for this to be more accurate to where I am in the book, it might be nice to have a category that tracks what chapter or minute youre on. If this was the case I would have a more comprehensive view of my progress throughout the read. Other than these two small tweaks I love it!    Developer Response, Thanks for your feedback.  In this case, I'd suggest creating a DNF shelf and making it \"exclusive,\" which will allow you to bypass the default shelves (\"read\", \"currently-reading\", and \"to-read\").  Books added to exclusive shelves cannot be added to other exclusive shelves (like \"read\"), but they can still be added to any of your non-exclusive custom shelves.  Here's how to make a shelf exclusive:1. Click on My Books in the header.2. Click on \"edit\" next to the \"Bookshelves\" header on the left.3. Find the shelf you'd like to make exclusive on your list of shelves, and click on the checkbox beneath \"exclusive.\"As a work around to track your progress for audiobooks, simply divide your current audiobook progress in hours into the total length of the audiobook to work out your %.  For example, if you're 3 hours into an 8 hour audiobook, you have made 38% progress (3/8 = 37.5%, rounded up to 38%).Hope this helps!

I love the ability to make shelves to save books.  It even lets you track the progress of books youre reading.  You can read your friends reviews or any reviews in general.

Browsing books by categories is also great because its helping me find different kinds of books so my reading list can be more diverse.  The only complaint I have (which actually isnt a real complaint) is that every time I click on this app, I find a million more books I want to read and theres no way I can read them all in my lifetime.    donaldtrumpslefttoe, 05/14/2021    Hi Goodreads. PLEASE ADD THESE THINGSThis app is wonderful. It is almost perfect. BUT every person Ive talked to who uses Goodreads have all been in agreement it would be a GAME CHANGER if these were added: 1) A 0.5 star option. It sounds silly but it can be so frustrating deciding if a book it 4 or 5 stars. If there was a 4.5 option for example, I think all my life problems would be solved. 2) Private ratings. Im sure if youre an app developer you know of Letterboxd, and for me personally, if some similar features could be added to Goodreads that would make it just *chefs kiss*. For example: one of my favorite things about Letterboxd is how your ratings dont account to a larger average rating for a movie (but in this case it would be a book). You can rate a movie and write your OWN review describing how that movie fit into your personal taste. I would love to see this on Goodreads in a way in which I could do a private review (almost like a personal diary) rather than a public rating. Sometimes ill read a book and recognize its objectively a great book, but I might give it two starts because maybe that sub-genre of fantasy romance wasnt up my alley, so maybe that review would be nice to have in a personal journal rather than a public one because my review is sort of niche. I hope this makes sense. :))) I LOVE THIS APP!!!    Klsy303, 02/08/2018    Wonderful!I don't have room in my house for a bookcase nor do I have enough money to buy all the books I love and display them in my house. Therefore, when I found goodreads I found the perfect way to create a digital bookcase with reviews and all! I simply adore it :)My only wish would be a DNF category aside from the usual ones (i.e.- \"Currently Reading\", \"To Read\", \"Read\"). Right now I have a handful of books on my \"Read\" list even though I didn't finish them. I hate taking credit for reading a book when I didn't but if I take it off my list I'll forget I tried it and try to read it later. In addition, I read many books via audiobooks and I want to update my progress under currently reading but I have no way of knowing what page Im on and typing in the percentage is a pure guess. In order for this to be more accurate to where I am in the book, it might be nice to have a category that tracks what chapter or minute youre on. If this was the case I would have a more comprehensive view of my progress throughout the read. Other than these two small tweaks I love it!    Developer Response, Thanks for your feedback.  In this case, I'd suggest creating a DNF shelf and making it \"exclusive,\" which will allow you to bypass the default shelves (\"read\", \"currently-reading\", and \"to-read\").  Books added to exclusive shelves cannot be added to other exclusive shelves (like \"read\"), but they can still be added to any of your non-exclusive custom shelves.  Here's how to make a shelf exclusive:1. Click on My Books in the header.2. Click on \"edit\" next to the \"Bookshelves\" header on the left.3. Find the shelf you'd like to make exclusive on your list of shelves, and click on the checkbox beneath \"exclusive.\"As a work around to track your progress for audiobooks, simply divide your current audiobook progress in hours into the total length of the audiobook to work out your %.  For example, if you're 3 hours into an 8 hour audiobook, you have made 38% progress (3/8 = 37.5%, rounded up to 38%).Hope this helps!

      "Momma Flan, 05/08/2019    Perfect for book lovers or casual readers.I usually never write reviews, but my life as a reader was totally changed after finding this app.  I love books and always have, but life keeps you busy and you end up putting things aside.  Well, this app has helped me find so many books I NEED to read, and it has helped me rediscover my love for reading!  I really cant think of anything to improve. I love the layout. I love the ability to make shelves to save books.  It even lets you track the progress of books youre reading.  You can read your friends reviews or any reviews in general.  I also love that they have a vote at the end of the year (or beginning, I cant remember) for best books in SEVERAL genres and also have best of the best and whatnot.  Browsing books by categories is also great because its helping me find different kinds of books so my reading list can be more diverse.  The only complaint I have (which actually isnt a real complaint) is that every time I click on this app, I find a million more books I want to read and theres no way I can read them all in my lifetime.    donaldtrumpslefttoe, 05/14/2021    Hi Goodreads. PLEASE ADD THESE THINGSThis app is wonderful. It is almost perfect. BUT every person Ive talked to who uses Goodreads have all been in agreement it would be a GAME CHANGER if these were added: 1) A 0.5 star option. It sounds silly but it can be so frustrating deciding if a book it 4 or 5 stars. If there was a 4.5 option for example, I think all my life problems would be solved. 2) Private ratings. Im sure if youre an app developer you know of Letterboxd, and for me personally, if some similar features could be added to Goodreads that would make it just *chefs kiss*. For example: one of my favorite things about Letterboxd is how your ratings dont account to a larger average rating for a movie (but in this case it would be a book). You can rate a movie and write your OWN review describing how that movie fit into your personal taste. I would love to see this on Goodreads in a way in which I could do a private review (almost like a personal diary) rather than a public rating. Sometimes ill read a book and recognize its objectively a great book, but I might give it two starts because maybe that sub-genre of fantasy romance wasnt up my alley, so maybe that review would be nice to have in a personal journal rather than a public one because my review is sort of niche. I hope this makes sense. :))) I LOVE THIS APP!!!    Klsy303, 02/08/2018    Wonderful!I don't have room in my house for a bookcase nor do I have enough money to buy all the books I love and display them in my house. Therefore, when I found goodreads I found the perfect way to create a digital bookcase with reviews and all! I simply adore it :)My only wish would be a DNF category aside from the usual ones (i.e.- \"Currently Reading\", \"To Read\", \"Read\"). Right now I have a handful of books on my \"Read\" list even though I didn't finish them. I hate taking credit for reading a book when I didn't but if I take it off my list I'll forget I tried it and try to read it later. In addition, I read many books via audiobooks and I want to update my progress under currently reading but I have no way of knowing what page Im on and typing in the percentage is a pure guess. In order for this to be more accurate to where I am in the book, it might be nice to have a category that tracks what chapter or minute youre on. If this was the case I would have a more comprehensive view of my progress throughout the read. Other than these two small tweaks I love it!    Developer Response, Thanks for your feedback.  In this case, I'd suggest creating a DNF shelf and making it \"exclusive,\" which will allow you to bypass the default shelves (\"read\", \"currently-reading\", and \"to-read\").  Books added to exclusive shelves cannot be added to other exclusive shelves (like \"read\"), but they can still be added to any of your non-exclusive custom shelves.  Here's how to make a shelf exclusive:1. Click on My Books in the header.2. Click on \"edit\" next to the \"Bookshelves\" header on the left.3. Find the shelf you'd like to make exclusive on your list of shelves, and click on the checkbox beneath \"exclusive.\"As a work around to track your progress for audiobooks, simply divide your current audiobook progress in hours into the total length of the audiobook to work out your %.  For example, if you're 3 hours into an 8 hour audiobook, you have made 38% progress (3/8 = 37.5%, rounded up to 38%).Hope this helps!",
